# Verilog-Projects
This is a public repository containing somee projects in verilog done by my group. The code was written and tested using Vivado 2015.2 Software.<br>
Low Level synthesis of the code was done using the same software and bitstream was generated. The code was then tested on a [Basys 3 Artix](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/1-54wqge.html) 7 FPGA Board.
Thanks for reading the code!
