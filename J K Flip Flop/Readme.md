# JK Flip Flop
This folder contains the RTL code and testbench files for a simple J K Flip Flop <br>
This project was used to test sequential logic on the FPGA board. A small challenge we faced was using a
frequency divider to slow the clock down to observe the toggling state of JK flipflop.
Also contains an XDC file for Basys 3 Beginner's board on which this code was tested upon.
