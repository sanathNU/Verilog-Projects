# Linear Feedback Shift Register
We have implemented a simple Linear Feedback Shift Register in Verilog. This was then tested in Basys 3 FPGA board.<br>
In this project the pseudo random numbers generated by the Linear Feedback shift register is transmitted to PC using UART communication.<br>
The generation rate of the LFSR is slowed down for visual debugging. Certain parts of the code are copied from our previous implementation of UART.<br>
More information for LFSR can be gained from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks1pw1X22y4). The wikipedia page is found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register).<br>
Documentation for the code will be added later.
