# Simple UART Transreceiver 
This small project contains code for a simple UART transmitter and receiver implemented in verilog.<br>
The code is specifically meant for Basys 3 FPGA board. UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter.<br> It is a simple method of transmitting data.
More information can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter)<br>
The software Terra Term was used for a virtual terminal in host PC operating on Windows 11. A single byte can be transmitted to the FPGA and received from the FPGA. Both the transmitter and receiver work in parallel.<br> Should work on proper documentation in the future.
