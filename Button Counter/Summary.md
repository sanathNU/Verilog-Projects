# Button Counter
Simple implementation of a button counter which displays the number of times a button is pressed. <br>
Code written specially for an FPGA board with 4 seven segment displays. We tested this on Basys 3 FPGA.<br> 
There is no testbench written for this code as this is basically a hardware project. Counters and loops have been used to achieve this result.

Code used is taken from the following website.<br>
